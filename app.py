#### What we're Solving:
- Clinicians often need ***quick, unified*** access to patient data, history, and similar cases for ***better decision-making, triage-assistance & staff training***
- Traditional tools struggle to process and scale large image volumes, & managing multi-modal data (image + text).
- Efficient storage, search, and retrieval of embeddings often becomes a bottleneck.
            
#### MedFuse Features:
- **Multi-modal search** over CT images + clinical notes
- **Real-time case retrieval** using MongoDB vector search
